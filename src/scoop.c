/**
 * \file scoop.c
 *
 * This file deals with readahead from caller-supplied buffers.
 *
 * Many functions require a certain minimum amount of input to do their
 * processing.  For example, to calculate a strong checksum of a block
 * we need at least a block of input.
 *
 * Since we put the buffers completely under the control of the caller,
 * we can't count on ever getting this much data all in one go.  We
 * can't simply wait, because the caller might have a smaller buffer
 * than we require and so we'll never get it.  For the same reason we
 * must always accept all the data we're given.
 *
 * So, stream input data that's required for readahead is put into a
 * special buffer, from which the caller can then read.  It's
 * essentially like an internal pipe, which on any given read request
 * may or may not be able to actually supply the data.
 *
 * As a future optimization, we might try to take data directly from the
 * input buffer if there's already enough there.
 */

/*
 * TODO: We probably know a maximum amount of data that can be scooped
 * up, so we could just avoid dynamic allocation.  However that can't
 * be fixed at compile time, because when generating a delta it needs
 * to be large enough to hold one full block.  Perhaps we can set it
 * up when the job is allocated?  It would be kind of nice to not do
 * any memory allocation after startup, as bzlib does this.
