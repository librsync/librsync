Instructions and conventions for people wanting to work on librsync.  Please
consider these guidelines even if you're doing your own fork. 

 * If you make a significant change (of more than 15 lines, say), then
   add yourself to the copyright for that file, and to the AUTHORS file.

 * THANKS contains a list of contributors for each release. If someone
   contributed a patch or bugreport, please add them under a
   "Contributors for X.Y.Z" heading at the bottom of the file.

 * NEWS contains a list of user-visible changes in the library between
   releases version. This includes changes to the way it's packaged,
   bug fixes, portability notes, changes to the API, and so on. Add
   and update items under a "Changes in X.Y.Z" heading at the top of
   the file. Do this as you go along, so that we don't need to work
   out what happened when it's time for a release.

 * Please try to update docs and tests in parallel with code changes.
